This is my first Techdegree project.
I am aiming to get an Exceeds Expectations grade on this project, so in addition to completing the all the instructions
outlined in the Project Instructions, I have also added an additional page, adjusting the css styling on the border-radius
property, added a new background and icons on the contact page and added more text to both pages.
The code has been run through the W3C HTML and CSS validator, and I have also tested for cross browser compatibility on
Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
